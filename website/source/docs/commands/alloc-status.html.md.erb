# Command: alloc-status

The `alloc-status` command displays status information and metadata about an
existing allocation and its tasks. It can be useful while debugging to reveal
the underlying reasons for scheduling decisions or failures, as well as the
current state of its tasks.

## Usage

```
nomad alloc-status [options] <allocation>
```

An allocation ID or prefix must be provided. If there is an exact match, the
full details of the allocation will be displayed. Otherwise, a list of matching
allocations and information will be displayed.

## General Options

<%= partial "docs/commands/_general_options" %>

## Alloc Status Options

* `-short`: Display short output. Shows only the most recent task event.
* `-verbose`: Show full information.
* `-json` : Output the allocation in its JSON format.
* `-t` : Format and display allocation using a Go template.

## Examples

Short status of an alloc:

```
$ nomad alloc-status --short 13901f26
ID            = 13901f26
Eval ID       = c3c9a1db
Name          = example.cache[0]
Node ID       = 1f029d38
Job ID        = example
Client Status = running
Created At    = 29/03/16 03:04:53 UTC

==> Tasks
Name   State    Last Event  Time
redis  running  Started     29/03/16 03:04:53 UTC
web    running  Started     29/03/16 03:04:53 UTC
```

Full status of an alloc, which shows one of the tasks dying and then being restarted:

```
$ nomad alloc-status cfe85e72
ID                  = cfe85e72
Eval ID             = cdc88569
